FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

*   **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). [One of the fastest Python frameworks available](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#performance).
*   **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
*   **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
*   **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
*   **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
*   **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
*   **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
*   **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (previously known as Swagger) and [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

* estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production applications.

**Typer**, the FastAPI of CLIs[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#typer-the-fastapi-of-clis "Permanent link")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[![Image 22](https://typer.tiangolo.com/img/logo-margin/logo-margin-vector.svg)](https://typer.tiangolo.com/)

If you are building a CLI app to be used in the terminal instead of a web API, check out [**Typer**](https://typer.tiangolo.com/).

**Typer** is FastAPI's little sibling. And it's intended to be the **FastAPI of CLIs**. ⌨️ 🚀

Requirements[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#requirements "Permanent link")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FastAPI stands on the shoulders of giants:

*   [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) for the web parts.
*   [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for the data parts.

Installation[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#installation "Permanent link")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create and activate a [virtual environment](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/virtual-environments/) and then install FastAPI:

```
$ pip install "fastapi[standard]"

---> 100%
```

**Note**: Make sure you put `"fastapi[standard]"` in quotes to ensure it works in all terminals.

Example[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#example "Permanent link")
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Create it[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#create-it "Permanent link")

Create a file `main.py` with:

```
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

Or use `async def`...
If your code uses `async` / `await`, use `async def`:

```
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}
```

**Note**:

If you don't know, check the _"In a hurry?"_ section about [`async` and `await` in the docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#in-a-hurry).

### Run it[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#run-it "Permanent link")

Run the server with:

```
$ fastapi dev main.py

About the command `fastapi dev main.py`...
The command `fastapi dev` reads your `main.py` file, detects the **FastAPI** app in it, and starts a server using [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/).

By default, `fastapi dev` will start with auto-reload enabled for local development.

You can read more about it in the [FastAPI CLI docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/fastapi-cli/).

### Check it[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#check-it "Permanent link")

Open your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery](http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery).

You will see the JSON response as:

```
{"item_id": 5, "q": "somequery"}
```

You already created an API that:

*   Receives HTTP requests in the _paths_`/` and `/items/{item_id}`.
*   Both _paths_ take `GET`_operations_ (also known as HTTP _methods_).
*   The _path_`/items/{item_id}` has a _path parameter_`item_id` that should be an `int`.
*   The _path_`/items/{item_id}` has an optional `str`_query parameter_`q`.

### Interactive API docs[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#interactive-api-docs "Permanent link")

Now go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

You will see the automatic interactive API documentation (provided by [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui)):

![Image 23: Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-01-swagger-ui-simple.png)

### Alternative API docs[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#alternative-api-docs "Permanent link")

And now, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc).

You will see the alternative automatic documentation (provided by [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc)):

![Image 24: ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-02-redoc-simple.png)

Example upgrade[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#example-upgrade "Permanent link")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now modify the file `main.py` to receive a body from a `PUT` request.

Declare the body using standard Python types, thanks to Pydantic.

```
from typing import Union

from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Item(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    is_offer: Union[bool, None] = None

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
def read_item(item_id: int, q: Union[str, None] = None):
    return {"item_id": item_id, "q": q}

@app.put("/items/{item_id}")
def update_item(item_id: int, item: Item):
    return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item_id}
```

The `fastapi dev` server should reload automatically.

### Interactive API docs upgrade[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#interactive-api-docs-upgrade "Permanent link")

Now go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs).

*   The interactive API documentation will be automatically updated, including the new body:

![Image 25: Swagger UI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-03-swagger-02.png)

*   Click on the button "Try it out", it allows you to fill the parameters and directly interact with the API:

![Image 26: Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-04-swagger-03.png)

*   Then click on the "Execute" button, the user interface will communicate with your API, send the parameters, get the results and show them on the screen:

![Image 27: Swagger UI interaction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-05-swagger-04.png)

### Alternative API docs upgrade[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#alternative-api-docs-upgrade "Permanent link")

And now, go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc).

*   The alternative documentation will also reflect the new query parameter and body:

![Image 28: ReDoc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/index/index-06-redoc-02.png)

### Recap[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#recap "Permanent link")

In summary, you declare **once** the types of parameters, body, etc. as function parameters.

You do that with standard modern Python types.

You don't have to learn a new syntax, the methods or classes of a specific library, etc.

Just standard **Python**.

For example, for an `int`:

```
item_id: int
```

or for a more complex `Item` model:

```
item: Item
```

...and with that single declaration you get:

*   Editor support, including:
    *   Completion.
    *   Type checks.

*   Validation of data:
    *   Automatic and clear errors when the data is invalid.
    *   Validation even for deeply nested JSON objects.

*   Conversion of input data: coming from the network to Python data and types. Reading from:
    *   JSON.
    *   Path parameters.
    *   Query parameters.
    *   Cookies.
    *   Headers.
    *   Forms.
    *   Files.

*   Conversion of output data: converting from Python data and types to network data (as JSON):
    *   Convert Python types (`str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list`, etc).
    *   `datetime` objects.
    *   `UUID` objects.
    *   Database models.
    *   ...and many more.

*   Automatic interactive API documentation, including 2 alternative user interfaces:
    *   Swagger UI.
    *   ReDoc.

* * *

Coming back to the previous code example, **FastAPI** will:

*   Validate that there is an `item_id` in the path for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
*   Validate that the `item_id` is of type `int` for `GET` and `PUT` requests.
    *   If it is not, the client will see a useful, clear error.

*   Check if there is an optional query parameter named `q` (as in `http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/foo?q=somequery`) for `GET` requests.
    *   As the `q` parameter is declared with `= None`, it is optional.
    *   Without the `None` it would be required (as is the body in the case with `PUT`).

*   For `PUT` requests to `/items/{item_id}`, read the body as JSON:
    *   Check that it has a required attribute `name` that should be a `str`.
    *   Check that it has a required attribute `price` that has to be a `float`.
    *   Check that it has an optional attribute `is_offer`, that should be a `bool`, if present.
    *   All this would also work for deeply nested JSON objects.

*   Convert from and to JSON automatically.
*   Document everything with OpenAPI, that can be used by:
    *   Interactive documentation systems.
    *   Automatic client code generation systems, for many languages.

*   Provide 2 interactive documentation web interfaces directly.

* * *

We just scratched the surface, but you already get the idea of how it all works.

Try changing the line with:

```
return {"item_name": item.name, "item_id": item_id}
```

...from:

```
... "item_name": item.name ...
```

...to:

```
... "item_price": item.price ...
```

...and see how your editor will auto-complete the attributes and know their types:

![Image 29: editor support](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/img/vscode-completion.png)

For a more complete example including more features, see the [Tutorial - User Guide](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/).

**Spoiler alert**: the tutorial - user guide includes:

*   Declaration of **parameters** from other different places as: **headers**, **cookies**, **form fields** and **files**.
*   How to set **validation constraints** as `maximum_length` or `regex`.
*   A very powerful and easy to use **Dependency Injection** system.
*   Security and authentication, including support for **OAuth2** with **JWT tokens** and **HTTP Basic** auth.
*   More advanced (but equally easy) techniques for declaring **deeply nested JSON models** (thanks to Pydantic).
*   **GraphQL** integration with [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/) and other libraries.
*   Many extra features (thanks to Starlette) as:
    *   **WebSockets**
    *   extremely easy tests based on HTTPX and `pytest`
    *   **CORS**
    *   **Cookie Sessions**
    *   ...and more.

Performance[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#performance "Permanent link")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Independent TechEmpower benchmarks show **FastAPI** applications running under Uvicorn as [one of the fastest Python frameworks available](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&runid=7464e520-0dc2-473d-bd34-dbdfd7e85911&hw=ph&test=query&l=zijzen-7), only below Starlette and Uvicorn themselves (used internally by FastAPI). (*)

To understand more about it, see the section [Benchmarks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/benchmarks/).

Dependencies[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#dependencies "Permanent link")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

FastAPI depends on Pydantic and Starlette.

### `standard` Dependencies[¶](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#standard-dependencies "Permanent link")

When you install FastAPI with `pip install "fastapi[standard]"` it comes with the `standard` group of optional dependencies:

Used by Pydantic:

*   [`email-validator`](https://github.com/JoshData/python-email-validator) - for email validation.

Used by Starlette:

*   [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/) - Required if you want to use the `TestClient`.
*   [`jinja2`](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) - Required if you want to use the default template configuration.
*   [`python-multipart`](https://github.com/Kludex/python-multipart) - Required if you want to support form "parsing", with `request.form()`.

Used by FastAPI:
